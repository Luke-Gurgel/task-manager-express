# task-manager-express

This is just a little Nodejs app that I built solely for learning purposes. Some of the technologies used include Nodejs, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, TypeScript and Jest. 

The app offers a simple REST API that enables clients to do things such as create, update and delete users, upload profile pictures, create, update and delete tasks for users, etc. 

As user records are stored in a MongoDB database, passwords are encrypted with bcryptjs. Requests are authorized via JWT to make sure that users only read and write data specific to them.

Although it's a very simple app, it was a great learning experience. Thanks for reading.
